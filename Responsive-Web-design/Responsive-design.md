### CSS Units

- Absolutes lengths: cm,mm,px,pt,in,pc
- Relative lengths: em,ex,rem,vh,vmin,vmax

    *The em and rem are considered relative, because they are relative to the font size of other elements*  

    - Use rems for better use of sizes, especially while playing with the text. 

*How to decide which unit to choose?*

- Font-size = rem
- padding and margin = em
- widths = em or percentage 

## Responsive layout basics

- Elements normally have a display:block or a display:inline as a default from the browser.

### Flex-box basics
